#+TITLE: Emacs Fnord theme

This is an implementation of the [[https://www.nordtheme.com][Nord colour palette]] for the Emacs
editor: "An arctic, north-bluish clean and elegant theme".

This project is a fork of [[https://github.com/nordtheme/emacs][Nordtheme/emacs]]. I take no credit for
creating the colour scheme; this project merely fixes some of the
problems of the original project and aims to be more
flexible/customizable.

** Installation
Currently, you can install straight from github:

#+begin_src elisp
  (package-vc-install "https://github.com/rjekker/fnord-theme")
#+end_src

Installing from Melpa will be added soon.

** Activation

#+begin_src elisp
  (require 'fnord-theme) ;; this will make sure to add the theme to the custom-theme-load-path
  (load-theme 'fnord)
#+end_src

** Improvements

Differences between this project and [[https://github.com/nordtheme/emacs][Nordtheme/emacs]]:

- Dropped support for terminals with a smaller colorspace
- Cleaner code, easier to customize or fix
- Fix [loading the theme in daemon mode](https://github.com/nordtheme/emacs/issues/59)
- Fix [tab-bar support](https://github.com/nordtheme/emacs/issues/105)
- Fix [trailing whitespace background](https://github.com/nordtheme/emacs/issues/79)
- Fix [Line number current line](https://github.com/nordtheme/emacs/issues/78)
- Comment colour is customizable
- Better colours for org headlines, see: https://github.com/nordtheme/emacs/issues/95, https://github.com/nordtheme/emacs/issues/98
- More complete support for several packages including magit
