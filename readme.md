# Emacs Fnord theme

This is an implementation of the [Nord colour palette](https://www.nordtheme.com) for the Emacs editor: "An arctic, north-bluish clean and elegant theme".

This project is a fork of
[Nordtheme/emacs](https://github.com/nordtheme/emacs). I take no
credit for creating the colour scheme; this project merely fixes some of the problems of the original project and aims to be
more flexible/customizable.

## Improvements

Differences between this project and [Nordtheme/emacs](https://github.com/nordtheme/emacs):

- Fix [loading the theme in daemon mode](https://github.com/nordtheme/emacs/issues/59)
