# Emacs Fnord theme

This is an implementation of the [Nord colour palette](https://www.nordtheme.com) for the Emacs editor: "An arctic, north-bluish clean and elegant theme".

This project is a fork of
[Nordtheme/emacs](https://github.com/nordtheme/emacs). I take no
credit for creating the colour scheme; this project merely fixes some of the problems of the original project and aims to be
more flexible/customizable.

## Improvements

Differences between this project and [Nordtheme/emacs](https://github.com/nordtheme/emacs):

- Fix [loading the theme in daemon mode](https://github.com/nordtheme/emacs/issues/59)
- Fix [tab-bar support](https://github.com/nordtheme/emacs/issues/105)
- Fix [trailing whitespace background](https://github.com/nordtheme/emacs/issues/79)
- Fix [Line number current line](https://github.com/nordtheme/emacs/issues/78)
- Comment colour is customizable
- Better colours for org headlines, see: https://github.com/nordtheme/emacs/issues/95, https://github.com/nordtheme/emacs/issues/98
